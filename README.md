# Some words about the project

This is a small fun project I have built where people can come and express their thoughts and emotions about their mental health and get some advice. The advice will be generated using OpenAI language model so it will be nowhere near an advice of an real therapist but I'm pretty sure it will be a fun experience. What's most interesting about the site is you can select some personas who are few of the popular individuals around the world! By selecting a persona whose personality resonates with them, you will receive personalized guidance and suggestions to help navigate your mental well-being. Hope you have fun playing with it. 

If you like the work please leave a star on the repo, helps me keep motivated.
